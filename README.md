# Milestone Project 2

## Hand Gesture Game(aka Rock Paper Scissors)

#### Project Colors
As for colour scheme, I have decided to use a dark background of some kind, will upload some examples as I find them to try out and see which one I like as the page evolves. My thoughts are dark background with medium grey colored header and white title. The reason I have decided this color combination is to allow the game itself to be more enhanced on the page, game background will be white or off white, possibly light grey. 

#### Project Fonts
Researched fun fonts that look good in a game, couldn't find any that I liked. Searched through Google Fonts and decided on 'Archivo' font. I like the way it looks with bold rounded letters and I think it will look good for a game display font.
